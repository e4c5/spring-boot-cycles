# Spring Boot Cycles Testbed
# This project intentionally contains circular dependencies for testing.

# In Spring Boot 2.6+, this setting would allow "soft" cycles (field/setter):
# spring.main.allow-circular-references=true

# However, this project ALSO has "hard" cycles (constructor and @Bean)
# which CANNOT be resolved even with this setting - they ALWAYS fail.

# Hard cycles in this project:
# - com.example.cycles.constructor: UserService <-> NotificationService
# - com.example.cycles.config: CacheManager <-> ConnectionPool

# The cycle detection tool should identify ALL cycles and suggest fixes:
# - @Lazy for soft cycles
# - Setter conversion or interface extraction for hard cycles
